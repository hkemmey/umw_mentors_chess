Structure / scaffolding
  1. Board Class
    - contains information about Board
    - location of pieces
    - 2d array of pieces (no piece represented by NULL)
    - a way to print the board( to the terminal )

  2. Abstract piece Class
    -each piece is a subclass
    -imagefile
      //castling
      //pawns moving forward two
      //pawns become queens if on oppenants back row
      //pawns of which back row is theirs
        --pawns need count moves to check legal moves
      -color is a variable
      -position
      -get position ??
      -get_valid_moves()
      -get_legal_moves()
        -depends on other pieces too

  3. GameState.py (Singleton)
    -score
    -state of Board
    -save()
        --creates a file that can restore the game state
        --save the board state as a string (Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN))
    -restore()
        --builds game based on save file
    -highscores file that is loaded in each time
    -CONSTANT starting state = "FEN starting string"
    -has a board
    -has pieces
  4. __init__.py()

  5. chess class (plays the game)
      -- rules of some kind (ie, check, checkmate, stalemate)
      -- pygame loop
          --each loop represents a turn
            --two conditional for each player
                if player 1's turn
                  --move a piece
                  --capture if necesarry
                  --pawns to queens
                  --win condition met?
                  --player_turn = player 2

                if player 2's player_turn
                  --win condition met?
                  --player_turn = player 1

      --has a GameState

  6. Simulation -- Testing our strategies against eachother -- use two player classes passed in as command line arguments
    -- compute moves by themselves
